            <h3>10 Day Trading Strategies for Beginners</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Knowledge Is Power</li>
                <p>In addition to knowledge of basic trading procedures, day traders need to keep up on the latest stock market news and events that affect stocks—the Fed's interest rate plans, the economic outlook, etc.So do your homework. Make a wish list of stocks you'd like to trade and keep yourself informed about the selected companies and general markets. Scan business news and visit reliable financial websites.</p>
                <li>Set Aside Funds</li>
                <p>Assess how much capital you're willing to risk on each trade. Many successful day traders risk less than 1% to 2% of their account per trade. If you have a $40,000 trading account and are willing to risk 0.5% of your capital on each trade, your maximum loss per trade is $200 (0.5% * $40,000).</p>
                <li>Set Aside Time, Too</li>
                <p>Day trading requires your time. That's why it's called day trading. You'll need to give up most of your day, in fact. Don’t consider it if you have limited time to spare.</p>
                <li>Start Small</li>
                <p>As a beginner, focus on a maximum of one to two stocks during a session. Tracking and finding opportunities is easier with just a few stocks. Recently, it has become increasingly common to be able to trade fractional shares, so you can specify specific, smaller dollar amounts you wish to invest.</p>
                <li>Avoid Penny Stocks</li>
                <p>You're probably looking for deals and low prices but stay away from penny stocks. These stocks are often illiquid, and chances of hitting a jackpot are often bleak.</p>
                <li>Time Those Trades</li>
                <p>Many orders placed by investors and traders begin to execute as soon as the markets open in the morning, which contributes to price volatility. A seasoned player may be able to recognize patterns and pick appropriately to make profits. But for newbies, it may be better just to read the market without making any moves for the first 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
                <li>Cut Losses With Limit Orders</li>
                <p>Decide what type of orders you'll use to enter and exit trades. Will you use market orders or limit orders? When you place a market order, it's executed at the best price available at the time—thus, no price guarantee.</p>
                <li>Be Realistic About Profits</li>
                <p>A strategy doesn't need to win all the time to be profitable. Many traders only win 50% to 60% of their trades. However, they make more on their winners than they lose on their losers. Make sure the risk on each trade is limited to a specific percentage of the account, and that entry and exit methods are clearly defined and written down.</p>
                <li>Stay Cool</li>
                <p>There are times when the stock markets test your nerves. As a day trader, you need to learn to keep greed, hope, and fear at bay. Decisions should be governed by logic and not emotion.</p>
                <li>Stick to the Plan</li>
                <p>Successful traders have to move fast, but they don't have to think fast. Why? Because they've developed a trading strategy in advance, along with the discipline to stick to that strategy. It is important to follow your formula closely rather than try to chase profits. Don't let your emotions get the best of you and abandon your strategy. There's a mantra among day traders: "Plan your trade and trade your plan."</p>

            <h3>The Basics of Currency Trading</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Forex exchanges allow for 24/7 trading in currency pairs, making it the world's largest and most liquid asset market.</li>
                <li>While it is the largest market in the world, a relatively small number (~20) of currency pairs are responsible for the majority of volume and activity.</li>
                <li>Currencies are traded against one another as pairs (e.g., EUR/USD) and each pair is typically quoted in pips (percentage in points) out to four decimal places.</li>
                <li>Currency prices fluctuate based on the economic situation of the countries involved, geopolitical risk and instability, and trade & financial flows, among other factors.</li>
